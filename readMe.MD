CBS Movie History

Template for splash.hbs complete. The file has the splash, login, and register moqup included within it. Some css was added just for visualization that will have to be changed over to sass (which I don't know how to use yet).  
Authentication complete and able to log in and register a new user.  Modules
hide and fade in as needed.  

Templates for logInButton.hbs and successfulRegister.hbs made to pull in data to the hmtl.  
  
Created a .fail to go along with the .reject of the promise, these actions are found on the entry.js line 51/52 and also the loginAuth.js line 35 is where the .reject is coded.
